ckb-boxer
=========

A minimal CKB distribution that includes only the chain verification part. All the other parts, such as networking, syncing, RPC, transaction pools, indexer, etc. have been stripped out. A simple stdin/stdout protocol will be used to communicate with the program(such as accepting new block).

The name comes from the sport boxer, where athletes will need to control the body weight to what's absolutely needed for the sport.
