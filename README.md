ckb-boxer
=========

A minimal CKB distribution that is packed as a Rust crate. All the moving parts, such as networking, syncing, RPC, transaction pools, indexer, etc. have been stripped out.

An example using simple stdin/stdout protocol to communicate with the program(such as accepting new block) has been provided.

The name comes from the sport boxing, where athletes will need to control the body weight to what's absolutely needed for the sport.
